If you change the auto configure file "configure.ac", then you will need
to run the command `autoconf`, if you get an error there then you need
re-generate the .m4 file by running the command `aclocal`. 

    Otherwise if you have not touched the "configure.ac" file then you can
specify the option --enable-cuda when running "./configure" Also if you
do not have root, then you will need to set a prefix of where the program
will be installed to.  So the command would look something like this
if you want cuda installed and you dont have root:
        ./configure --prefix=PATH_TO_INSTALL --enable-cuda

By running the command above, will generate a #define CUDA_READY 1.

./configure will generate the Makefile.  So if you have previously ran "make",
then you will have to run "make clean", especially if you have configured
the directory without cuda previously.

After you run "make clean", then by running "make" will ensure that the code 
that checks for the #ifdef is run properly compiled depending on how you 
configured.

To install autodock, you simply need to run the command "make install"

The executable will be located wherever you specified the path for the
installation to place the executable in the --prefix= option.

So quick recap to create version for cuda:
1. run ./configure --prefix=PATH_TO_INSTALL --enable-cuda
2. "make clean" if a previous version was already configured
3. "make"
4. "make install"
5. navigate to PATH_TO_INSTALL, and autodock should be located there in a bin 
    folder.
6. have a beer.
